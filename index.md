# Welcome!

My main (research) interests are economic development and social research. In particular, to evaluate the impact of public policies and social programs, in order to determine whether there is really an improvement in quality of life indicators.

In addition, I apply data analysis and machine learning to the data in the above-mentioned branches. You can find more information about me in the [About](/about) section of this website.

The [Resources](/resources) section serves as a repository of miscellaneous material that I've worked on over the years, while [Posts](/posts) collects brief blog-type posts I've made about various topics.
Many of the projects that I'm working on (or not) are hosted on [my Github repo](https://www.github.com/nicohm), which also hosts most of the material listed in [Resources](/resources).

## About this site

This page is born for the motivation of contributing a grain of sand to the community and as a personal project in my way to the investigation.
