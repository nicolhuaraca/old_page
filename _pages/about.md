I'm Nicol Huaraca, Bachelor in Economics, graduated from the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos.
My main (research) interests are economic development and social research. In particular, to evaluate the impact of public policies and social programs, in order to determine whether there is really an improvement in quality of life indicators.
I have developed several [Stata, R, Julia and Python routines](/resources), all of which are available in my [Git repo](http://www.github.com/nicohm).
I am also writing manuals about the use of data science tools and different software.

You can find my CV [here](/cv).
I've collected much of my work in the [research](/research) and [resources](/resources) sections of this website.
You can contact me at **nicol.huaraca@yahoo.com**.
